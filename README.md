# Utils
A set of utils that I have been copying/pasting across my different projects. This library is so I don't need to update the code in many places if I want to change something.

## signal_util
Listens for SIGINT and SIGKILL signals to gracefully stop any running threads or loopers.

## logger
A logger that is set up with my personal preferences so I can reuse it on all my projects without needing to copy/paste the file
